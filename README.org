#TITLE: Bottom sh
Bottom encoder and decoder in sh
* Usage
#+begin_src sh
# Encode and decode in a single pipeline
echo "Hello, 世界!" | ./encode | ./decode
# Hello, 世界!

# Encode and save to file
echo "Hello, world" | ./encode >file

# Decode from file
./decode <file
#+end_src

You can either use ~decode-buf~ or ~decode-checkchar~. Both of them seem
equally fast. ~decode~ and ~decode-buf~ are the same.
* Caveats
The input to ~encode~ and ~decode~ /must/ end with a newline.
